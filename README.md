# Projects

Sadly, many IT organizations aren't aware of **Ansible**, or other configuration managers--like Puppet of Chef. As someone in IT, I would like to incorporate Ansible into the company I happened to be employed at. I believe Ansible has as much core value as Powershell or Bash.

All project below use **Infrastructure as Code**, using Ansible as idempotent code.

- [/01_vm_create_windows2016](https://github.com/techienaut/ansible/tree/master/01_vm_create_windows2016)
  - Creating a windows VM in Azure, that Ansible can administrate.
- [/02_cisco_ios](https://github.com/techienaut/ansible/tree/master/02_cisco_ios)
  - Cisco lab in GNS3, that Ansible can administrate from an Ubuntu VM server.
